    <h2>The Startup Struggle is Real</h2>
    <p>Are you a startup founder with a brilliant idea but struggling to find the technical expertise to bring it to life? You're not alone. Many startups face the challenge of finding and affording top engineering talent, especially in the competitive AI space. The cost of hiring a full-time engineering team can be prohibitive, and the search for qualified candidates can be time-consuming and frustrating. This can significantly delay your launch and impact your ability to secure funding.</p>
